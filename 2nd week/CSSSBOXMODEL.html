  <p>Hybrid sports cars are increasingly common thanks to electricity's performance-enhancing qualities, but the 2020 BMW i8 is more about looking fast than going fast. Still, the BMW provides a show-stopping entrance regardless of whether its dihedral doors open on the hardtop coupe or convertible roadster. While its plug-in powertrain is respectably powerful—and quicker than lesser hybrids—you're more likely to see one tear around a Whole Foods parking lot than your local racetrack. A user-friendly ride and comfortable front seats make the 2020 i8 usable every day;
  however, its limited storage space and compromised cabin access might cross it off most people's list.</p>
