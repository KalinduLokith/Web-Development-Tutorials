<p>Six years after its market launch, the i8 Coupe (and the newer Roadster) are ending their product life cycles with the 2020 model year. Both all-wheel-drive models are powered by a combination of hybrid synchronous electric motor and BMW TwinPower Turbo technology, a 228-hp, 1.5-litre three-cylinder gas engine. The engine’s power is channeled to the rear wheels through a six-speed Steptronic automatic transmission,
 while the electric motor propels the front wheels via a two-speed automatic gearbox.</p>

 <p>The I8 was the BMW flagship hybrid supercar, and it looks like something from outer space. The exotic yet futuristic design established the car as the manufacturer’s first step towards a new generation of cars and combined luxury with the plug-in hybrid experience. Many enthusiasts were excited when the car debuted in 2013 at the 2013 Frankfurt Motorshow, but it gathered more than a few laughs by the company’s choice of a combustion engine, 
 and it has led many people to incorrectly assume that this supercar would underperform.
